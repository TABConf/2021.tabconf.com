          TABConf is trying something new in 2021! This year's conference will be divided into five camps,
          each focusing on a different area of blockchain&nbsp;technology.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Gamer Camp</li>
          <li>Socratic Camp</li>
          <li>Privacy Camp</li>
          <li><em>Your camp here?</em></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Each camp has it's own leader, who will be handling the programming for their area.
          We will be updating you soon as the camp leaders prepare their schedules.
        </p>
